aerie citizen aarakocran~
a citizen of the Aerie~
Bustling along, a citizen of the Aerie goes about their business.
~
From their ruffled feathers and harried look, it is clear that this 
citizen of the Aerie is in a big hurry! He moves quickly along, the
darting movement of his eyes scanning for anything in his way.

a swan of the Aerie~
Singing cheerfully, an aarakocran citizen tends to her nest.
~
With neatly tidied feathers and a calm demeanor, this aara swan tends
to the structure of her nest. Her feathers are a soft brown, and with
her deep, dark eyes, she is a lovely example of her race. She seems a
bit preoccupied, as if something is weighing on her mind.

young adult bird aarakocran~
a young adult aarakocran~
Feathers fly everywhere as a young adult aarakocran careens by.
~
Clearly, this young adult bird is not looking where he is going. He 
careens through the passageways of his home, wingtips sliding along
the stones scattering glossy gray feathers everywhere. An aviator's
hat is off-kilter atop his head, marking him a member of Whrrteet's
Wings.

Whrrteet Captain aarakocran~
Whrrteet, Captain of the Wings~
With painted feathers along his wings, Whrrteet cuts an impressive figure.
~
Whrrteet has the sable wings of a member of the Black Flight, but the white
paint upon his feathers shows he is no longer a member of that group.  Atop
his head is a jaunty aviator helmet, the symbol he has taken for his motley
crew of young avians. His dark eyes flash with purpose as he instructs some
Junior Wing members in their tasks for the day.

A slim aarakocran sage works his store with a quiet diligence.
~
Old leathery hands work expertly with the combination of ingredients for his
next creation. His fingers are stained from years of mixing potions and herb
tinctures. Focused on his work, the apothecary pays little attention to his 
customers until they are ready to buy.

a distressed aarakocran swan~
The whirlwind of notes trilled by this aarakocran proclaims her distress.
~
This poor aarakocran swan witnessed her chick being carried off by a roc,
and her piteous cries are enough to break the most hardened heart. She is
trilling loudly, begging anyone for help, while simultaneously tearing a
feather from her breast with her beak, each time she pauses her pleas.

patrons and making good money doing it, too.

an aarakocran, groggy from sleep~
An aarakocran attempts to catch a quick nap.
~
Tired from a long flight, this aarakocran wants nothing more than to 
sleep.  His aching wing joints are visibly swollen and inflamed from
over-exertion and the tips of his feathers are tinged with green, as
if he dipped a bit low and brushed against the foliage several times
as he flew.

demonstrates his talents as a cook on a daily basis.

a crotchety old aara shopkeeper~
A grey-feathered, white-crested, beady-eyed old aarakocran is here.
~
With an apparent tendency toward kleptomania or perhaps an obsessive
disorder, this old veteran has spent most of his days collecting a 
wide variety of objects. It appears he has traveled far and wide in
his time by the looks of his collection. His clothing is as eclectic
as his wares: bits of decrepit armor mixed with more casual clothing. 
An ancient, shriveled leaf of green has been pinned with care to the 
shoulder of his tunic

An older but very attractive lady aarakocra wanders around, offering help.
~
Dealing mostly in clothing made by aarakocrans for aarakocrans, this lady 
has had several years' experience. She has a solid reputation for good 
customer service and has excellent advice about what not to wear. Her 
plumage is dark, save for a brilliant splash of white feathers at her brow.
She clucks softly as she examines what you are wearing and how your clothes
speak about who you are.

Standing tall with a wide wingspan, a blue heron goes by.
~
Looking into the face and eyes of this blue heron, it is striking how
reptilian this bird truly is.  It regards you closely, wondering what
kind of threat you may pose. The long, stilt-like legs of this bird
seem almost too fragile to hold up its body. As it ruffles its wings, 
displaying a wingspan nearly that of an adult aara, the impression of 
fragility disappears.

The purple woodpecker flies around anxiously, seeking a canvas of wood 
in which to sink its eager beak. Bugs are a favored meal, judging from 
the fleshy bits that crust its feathers around its mouth.  It is not a 
very neat or tidy eater.

stuffs discarded by his aarakocran fellows. Casting aside any attempt to

Her wings are tucked closely to her body as this aara swan moves through
the Aerie, thinking intently about the tasks she must complete today. An
errant feather drifts downward as she scratches her head with one yellow
claw, a sign she is distracted to no end.

large for its species. Twin antennae of black jut upward from its head, a

He just wants to get back to his Barbegazi people and the safety of being

fail in its flight and plummet to a blessedly swift death - but that

a young aarakocran of the Aerie~
Sent on an errand by his mother, this aarakocran dashes through the Aerie.
~
With ruffled feathers and a slightly disheveled tail that looks like it 
may have gotten swatted a time or two, this young male aarakocran does
as he has been told to do - go quickly on some errands and head straight
back home.

drow ambassador~
the Drow royal ambassador~
With his amethyst eyes and dark skin, this Drow elf draws immediate attention.
~
His elegant clothing and quiet, regal demeanor set this Drow apart from 
the chaos and feathers of the Aerie. His amethyst eyes flicker as every
detail is observed, cataloged and memorized for later report to the Old
Council of D'or d'Terraithe.  He schools his expression to show no sign
of his thoughts as he waits to address the Aerie's leadership. Twisting
braids bind his metallic silver hair back from his face. Black cords of
silk are woven into the braids, each bearing a magical sigil made of an
inky-black metal. They ring lightly against one another as he nods, the 
sound disarmingly pure and sweet.

~
The crest and wings of this aarakocran are bleached pale with age and sun,
and his shoulders are thin and frail. Still, his attention is keen, even 
if his eyes are not, as he listens to the voices of the Aerie and tends
diligently to their needs.

With a disheveled crest, obviously ruffled in frustration, this aarakocran
argues his point with the Councilors. His eyes flicker repeatedly over to
the ambassador as he argues for the Drow's banishment from the Aerie and
an end to any formal relations with D'or D'Terraithe.

With aristocratic bearing and a carefully composed expression of interest

to all those who wish to present a matter before the Council. She nods,

Shaman of Aerie Volant.  While there are lesser students who could tend
to the Roc, it is a task that she has retained.  She chirrs softly in a
low, pleasing tone, communicating with the ancient beast.  Her smile is
a clear indicator of the bond she feels with it, and her yellow stained
fingers a sign of the many banana slugs she has offered up.

One wing held out in an awkward angle, this aarakocran is crippled.
~
From the painful hobbling gait of this aarakocran, the wounds he took 
long ago while on patrol are a deep burden. His left leg is stiff and 
unbending, the joint of the knee completely fused. His left wing will 
not fold properly against his body. Instead, it juts out at an angle, 
constantly getting further jarred and battered. From the weariness in
his dark eyes, it is clear this broken soldier longs to seek the rest
from which he will never wake.

aara looks a bit flustered. A sudden frantic scratching at her neck
feathers may reveal why; someone spread chickflea eggs in her nest,
infesting it. Whether it was a practical joke from a fellow Wing or
the dastardly act of sabotage of a Black Winger, she does not know,
but her misery is plain to see.

this aara is trying hard to stay focused on his tasks for the day and

he takes his role in the Watch quite seriously, despite his new status,
that the practical joker of the Aerie has not made him the butt of any 
jests yet.

to the aara, who cannot fathom why he has such a profusion of hair
on his face. His arthritic hands are gnarled but still able to tie
a knot in a net and this has given him a new purpose to fill time
until he is rescued... but he isn't happy about it.

form known as the Yochlol, has been used in rich excess to craft these full,
sweeping court robes. Glowing runes of amethyst and ruby thread have been
set into place with spell and song along the neckline, hem and cuffs, to 
ward the wearer.

Before the Cliff~
You stand upon a narrow path of smooth white stone, surrounded by dense brush. 
To the north, a sheer white cliff rises above the foliage, stretching east and 
west as far as normal eyes can see. A waterfall emerges from an gorge part-way 
up the cliff. A series of narrow pathways seem to lead towards the summit, and
several small structures can be seen along the route. Winged figures soar amid
the currents along and above the cliff face. The loud sound of water splashing
crashes in from the west, where a deep pool can be seen. A damp pathway snakes
to the west and to the north the stone walkway continues.

A Path At the Foot of the Cliff~
The path passes under a graceful arch of stone as it reaches the foot of the 
cliff and starts up a gentle incline, veering sharply to the west. Delicate, 
thin ornamental spires crafted from the white stone of the cliff, are evenly 
and deliberately spaced at the edge of the path, delineating its border.  A 
fine mist fills the air, cast up from the ornate stone well to the west.

The path here slopes gently upward toward the west. Delicate ornamental 
spires, crafted from the white stone of the cliff, delineate the route.
Overhead, a waterfall flows from the cliffs above, arcing over the path 
in a rainbow-filled cascade. The waterfall and rainbows end in an ornate 
stone-lined pool directly to the south, some of the water diverted here 
to fill a well.  To the east, the path curves a bit to blend with the 
hills that spread out further to the south-east.

It provides passage up and down, or one can step off the stair onto a ledge 
that extends to the east across the cliff face. Overhead, numerous avian 
figures glide, catching air foils and wind currents or moving about the cliff.
The open air beckons to the south, but one would have to be flying to exit

Aerie proper and west, where it stops in front of a shop. Here and there 
are loose rocks, pebbles, and other various rubble. In spite of this, the 
path seems generally safe and the footing secure.

A tunnel leads directly into the cliff face to the north, at the end of 
which a faint light is visible. Aarakocran silhouettes move to and fro 
within. Churning through the center of the tunnel, slopping over both 
sides of a deep channel, a swiftly-moving flow of water ejects from the 
cliff, pouring over the edge and cascading to the ground below. A small 
footbridge has been placed across the racing water, allowing the path 
running east and west to continue uninterrupted.

It bisects a pathway that travels across the cliff to the east, where it

Here and there are loose rocks, pebbles, and other various rubble. In

The tunnel is wide and high enough to fly in comfortably. Directly to
the south, the tunnel opens out onto the cliff face and a small point
of bright light is visible farther to the north. A channel of fast-moving
water, deep but just barely narrow enough to leap across, flows in from 
the northwest and out to the south, directly down the center of the tunnel.
Directly to the east and west, open archways reveal shops beyond.

A channel of fast-moving water, deep but just barely narrow enough

a slight mist drifts follows the water channel in the floor from the 
east, carried by a breeze that also brings the sound of laughter and 
splashing to your ears.

A Residential Chamber~
This sizeable chamber is very clearly split down the middle, as if the 
occupants have done everything possible, by rearranging the furniture, 
to create two separate living spaces in which they can utterly ignore 
one another. Two beds that appear to have once been bunk beds but were
forcibly disassembled are shoved up against the furthest walls and two 
chests of drawers divine the chamber in half, each facing in the other 
direction. A white rug rests next to the bed to the west and a black rug 
is by the bed to the east. A fluttering parchment has been nailed to the 
inside of the door that leads south to the outdoors.

A Formal Guest Chamber~
Every effort has been made to make this chamber a welcoming one for the 
various guests of the Aerie.  In the case of the current occupant, that
means everything has a stunning degree of luxury and sensual indulgence.
Velvet drapes surround a huge canopy bed crafted of black nightwood, an
elegant chandelier of adamantite and black crystal hangs from the rocky
ceiling above. A fire has been laid in a massive hearth, and underfoot,
a profusion of thickly piled carpets creates a sybaritic experience for
the feet. Heaped with scrolls and documents, a heavily carved desk is a
perfect match to the bed in craftsmanship and quality.

from Cillidellia lay atop coarse mats of twisted grass fiber, mingled
with heavy felted wool rugs made by the centaurs of the north. As a 
whole, they create a cacophony of sensation underfoot.

A Cliffside Plateau~
The amount of time it must have taken to carve out this plateau upon the
cliffside is staggering. An area easily as wide as three or four giants
are tall, has been chiseled away, creating a landing and launching point
for the aara of the Aerie. To the south, a wide opening leads into the 
cliff side itself, and above, the air swirls and tosses from the movement
of a strange, gray storm-like vortex. Small birds are cast about by the
force of the gale winds that emerge from it.

Ascending the Cliff~
A white stone staircase, chiseled from the cliff rock, continues both up 
and down its face. The rock gleams and glistens in the daylight or moon
light, kept forever moist by the mists welling up from below.

Flying Above the Waterfall~
Just below, a waterfall escapes the cliff side from a large tunnel, and far
below, the cascade generates a fantastic mist which plumes gently upward. 
At this height, the mist is a thin veil, cool and pleasant. The air is
relatively calm as it brushes the moisture on the sheer cliff wall.

A white stone staircase, chiseled from the cliff rock, continues both up and

A Very Precarious and Narrow Ledge~
This ledge is dangerous, away from the shelter of the cliff, and the erratic
currents of the wind tug constantly at loose belongings. Similarly, the rock
is loose and treacherous, turning underfoot with each step. Scuff marks show
where others, less cautious, have fallen over the edge.

debris from up top falls in, showering passersby with gravel.

An open-air trench has been painstakingly carved out here, providing 
excellent shelter from the howling winds above. To the north and south, 
the path continues. To the west, the cliffs have been tunneled into, 
creating sheltering caves. The entrance is grand - runes and symbols 
have been engraved on the rock face immediately around the opening, 
and the rock itself has been ornately carved. A draft comes from a 
tunnel leading downward.

The Grand Entry of the Aerie Volant~
A great archway marks the entrance to the Aerie Volant's Council Chamber,
Elders gather to govern this cliff-dwelling community. The Aerie itself
was excavated directly from the white rock of the cliff and extends high 
overhead. An oculus at the center of the ceiling opens to the swirling 
air above. Some distance up the walls in each corner, outcroppings of 
rock remain to serve as perches upon which citizens attending meetings 
might rest.

Atop the Aerie Volant~
Below, the top of a cliff runs east and west, but the view in all 
directions is absolutely spectacular. Flying higher would enhance 
the view. Downward, an opening is visible in the top of the cliff, 
leading to a huge stone chamber.

The Communal Baths~
This spacious chamber is filled with a cool mist, created by the 
torrential waterfall pouring in from a hole in the ceiling above. 
Several seemingly natural pools dot the floor, allowing the water
to spill from one to the next, calming it somewhat, where citizens 
of the Aerie Volant can come to bathe.  Fountains line the walls 
to centralize the supply of fresh water, their basins carved with 
ornamental designs. An open passageway arches over a deep channel
that siphons off the overflow to the east. To the west, another
opening leads to some sort of food and entertainment area, judging
from the smells and sounds emerging from it.

The Origin of the Falls~
The sound of water rushing from a wide channel in the north-east corner 
of this chamber is nearly deafening, amplified by the acoustics of the
chamber. The water washes over the pale stone floor, making your footing 
uncertain, then tumbles downward through a gaping hole. To the west, one 
can access a side-tunnel.

A Tunnel Through the Mountain~
This tunnel is quite large, easily wide enough to fly in. Sounds echo

to the north, east, and south, and the dissonance can be confusing to 
those new to the Aerie.

The walls of this stone chamber walls are lined with charred grooves 
ripping through the rock, evidence that powerful spells have been 
cast in practice here - sometimes going awry. Tables line the north
wall, and upon them, several ruined fetishes and several other more
successful attempts in progress are laid in neat rows. A darker chamber 
lies to the west, the portal to it surrounded by powerful runes.

the Aerie Volant have trained here for ages uncounted. All are welcome 
to enter this chamber -- a key element in shamanic training is being 
able to avoiding distraction while maintaining focus. The air is sweet
with the scent of unique incenses and slightly hazy with their smoke.

Ozymandiut the 1st, the Month of the Testing of the Fates

When will that old bat realize that her spells fizzle like a sparklie
that has burned its last? The aerie needs new blood, new focus, and
I know that I can help us be ready for the conflicts ahead. We are
found - no longer isolated - and we must prepare for more interaction,
and not less, with those around us. I have begun tutoring and mentoring
as I can, hoping beyond hope to pass along what I know, before it
is too late.

Kelir the 5th, Month of Reconciliation

She came, attendants and all, attempting to stop my lessonings. Not
my place, she said -- yet still refuses to teach the younglings even
as simple a spell as the rift! Only the defensive magics - none of 
what we will need to know, should the Orc and Drow attempt to invade.
I tried to make her understand, but she would not listen.

The first class has graduated, and with it, some recognition from
the Councilors. They, at least, understand -- what I am trying to do, 
and what it means to the city. They have moved me into her old cave.
I found one of her pinion feathers driven into the very stone of

Inside the Chamber of the Master Legerdemain~
Several candles provide dim light in this rock chamber, walls roughly chiseled
leaving many angular protrusions, and many, many shadows. Surprisingly quiet,
stealth training is easier here. To the south, light filters in from the sun
or moon through a shallow alcove in the cliff.

The cliff side path opens up into a fairly spacious area. To the north is an
opening in the white cliff rock, and east another opening. This space feels
more like a yard. Small rocks and gravel make for a rough surface, and rock
benches have been either placed or carved in strategic locations around the
perimeter.

Excavated from the white rock of the cliff, this room has ornate walls 
and ornamentation with a martial theme. On the east wall, masterfully 
carved in relief, are scenes of great aara warriors engaged in battle 
with beasts of varying natures and origins, flanking a heavy oak door. 
A rack containing an array of weapons keeps the south wall company. To 
the north, the cliff has been hollowed out into yet another chamber. A 
wide cliff path leads out west.

The Inner Chamber of the Master Martial~
This chamber has long been the domicile of the Aerie Volant's lead warrior.
Through the ages, several great Aarakocrans have held the title of Master
Martial. The current Master Martial likes only moderate decoration - the
giant skull of a mastodon is mounted as a centerpiece in a large alcove on
the north side of the room. The tusks spiral downward from the ceiling
around the alcove -- forming a clever columnar design to frame the skull.
Several books on defense and the art of war line a shelf on the east wall,
and a heavy-duty fishing rod hangs on the wall above it.

A Quiet White Stone Foyer~
Off the beaten path, this foyer provides an exquisite entryway to a 
home that cannot be described as humble. It is clear that the artist
was no bird, for the strong, stout columns and motifs are surely the 
work of a dwarf.  The white rock has been chiseled away, worked with 
care and precision by skilled hands. The walls are ornately carved 
into white lattice work and faces in relief peer out, lifelike and 
smiling pleasantly. The faces seem to be of all the known races, 
including sahuagin and giant.

where in the distance, a bright speck of light is barely visible, and
another tunnel to the west, ornately carved and ornamented. A strong,
mist-laden breeze blows in from the south, where a waterfall arches 
over the cliff opening.

A Groove into the Cliff~
The sound of aarakocrans calling to one another echoes strangely in 
this deep cleft carved into the cliff. It extends to the south and 
to the north, where a deep shaft plunges downward, creating strange 
wind currents from every direction. Above, the strong winds whistle
counterpoint to the aaras' songs, and it is not uncommon for a shower 
of pebbles to fall down from the top of the  cliff, swept in by the 
breezes.

A touch of elegance might be the best way to describe this home - shiny
baubles and trinkets are everywhere. What little furniture exists is rich
wooden construction, and velvet pillows are strewn about the floor. The
walls are covered with Aarakocran feather art. Designs of feathers from
all the known birds (or so it seems) adorn every bit of available space.
One detailed oil painting rests on a small outcropping on the north wall
over a bed: a crotchety old aarakocran in what appears to be his shop of
trinkets.

The white stone ledge comes to an end here. An elegant railing has been

spot seems to provide both a beautiful view and ideal picnic spot for 
visitors - and an excellent military vantage point for observing the lands 
and skies to the west and south of the Aerie. Strong winds flow over the 
ledge, too strong to allow its use as a launching or landing point.

ensures that not a single thing leaves without being paid for. Foot

the open air of the ledge is a temptation for the more exuberant.

their own family recipes into the selections, which may or may not

six to eight comfortably and one formal table seating at least twenty.
Along the eastern wall, a wide array of casks and barrels awaits the

hide stretched taut across creating a smooth, quiet surface. Leaves,

A slender male aarakocran with gray pinions grins at you from this 
painting. He appears to be standing atop a peak, the wind ruffling 
his feathers to reveal a vivid green under-coloring on his breast. 
His beak is short and quite pointed, almost as if he sharpened it
for additional weaponry in battle. Aviator goggles have been moved
back on his head and a jaunty scarf flutters in the strong breeze.
His hands, half-hidden in gloves of dark forest green, rest on his

In the Meditation Chamber~
The Apothecary has obviously supplied this room with several items, 
as mystic scents filter through a dozen carefully constructed incense 
burners. Cushions line the room. Plush carpets and down feathers occupy 
every square foot of the chamber floor. Magicked candles have been set 
into the walls, never burning low or blowing out, providing a constant, 
calm, warming light. A small area appears to be set aside as a living
space for the one who provides mentoring: a tidy nest, table, and books.

table tables~
Atop the lone, low wood table is a woven reed mat. Resting on the mat
are several books: the topmost one appears to be a journal, the ink 
still wet on the most recent page.

Jawiliea the 10th, the Month of the Testing of the Fates

Puzzled, am I, at events that have recently turned.
More and more, our young ones are flocking to that
wretch who seeks to take my place. Fewer and fewer
come to the meditations. We are no longer as snowy
geese, in formation, working as one, each taking a
turn in leadership, each supportively honking. Now
it is brash loudness. It is secrets to be revealed
only to sycophants instead of through the Mother's
grace. Sorrow is mine.

Kelir the 1st, Month of Reconciliation
In keeping with this month, I have gone and humbled
myself, seeking to understand, to extend a wing. To 
be all that the Mother wishes of her child. Failure
was mine. Instead of calmness, hurt. Instead of the
tranquility I sought, arguments. I will try again.

Ivyn the 21st, Month of Shallow Graves
The chaos of the Aerie disrupts the Nest's peace. A
sign must come, else I am lost. I have left my mark
in the wall of what was once my home, my place, the
joy of my existence, my duty. Let them remove it if
they can.

Marisae the 18th, Month of the Dawning
Her Grace has not befallen as I had hoped. The furor
builds and now those who are not of us are among us.
I do not trust the one who came with sly words, rich
offerings and the curious eyes. I will seek the wise
council of the Mother and pray for their departure.

Cearn the 3rd, Month of the Thawing Ice
My place as the teacher of the young is surrendered.
I see this not with eyes of peace but with hurt and 
a touch of anger. I must surrender this to the Mother
and embrace Her peace.

Rishanae the 7th, Month of Renewal
With the season's turnings, so has my peace returned.
I accept the way of things, this new order.  Yet have 
I things to teach, a place and a need to fill. Nearer
to the Nest, I find my thoughts more gentle and wise.
Calm amidst the chaos.

The Great Nest~
This chamber is silent and peaceful, the noise of the council chambers
having seemingly melted away. The ground is covered in a layer of thin
willow reeds, feathers, soft cloth, and all manner of other material,
creating a nest. The walls have been carved to resemble the enclosing
wings of a great bird, as if a great Mother crouched above the nest,
protecting it.

High Above the Aerie Volant~
The view from here is amazing. To the north, the sea stretches to 
the horizon. To the west, still more sea and perhaps an island or 
two, although it is difficult to be sure. To the east, the cliff 
continues for a distance and ends abruptly where the Sava River 
has cut a path to the sea. To the south, land and sky come together 
far, far away, and the Sava River flows its course.

Before the Cliff~
Winding ahead is a narrow path of smooth white stone, surrounded by dense
brush. To the north, a sheer cliff rises above the foliage, stretching
east and west as far as the eyes can see. A waterfall emerges from an
opening partway up the cliff, cascading down and sending forth a fine 
mist as it plunges into a pool. A series of narrow paths seems to lead 
to the top of the cliff, and several small structures can be seen along 
them, among which several winged figures drift through the air.

The Waterfall's Pool~
The cascade of water ends here in a wide, gleaming pool. The edges have been
reinforced with carefully placed stones, forming a neat border of pale white.
A smaller section of water has been diverted into a well, with a convenient
ledge for residents to rest their buckets. Another area has been set aside for
the washing of clothes. The ground is moist and soft, with lush vegetation 
all around. A small pathway leads to the east and west, and to the north, 
tall cliffs of white rise up just beyond a decorative archway.
