Borlan quartermaster~
Borlan~
Borlan the quartermaster is here.
~
Borlan will store any equipment that you wish him to.  In fact, he
encourages you to store your things with him, so that he can pay off
his "little" debt to Merrick, whom he considers nothing more than a
petty thief and scoundrel.  Only the fact that the Midgaard authorities
consider Merrick's activities legal stands between Borlan going after
Merrick with the well-used sword he keeps at his side.  The sword is
reputed to be of ancient design and power, and has been used to take
care of those that might disrupt his business.  You notice a peculiar
scar that goes around Borlan's muscular neck, which Borlan chooses not
to hide.  Rather, it is the mute testimony of an assassination attempt
that Borlan is convinced Merrick was behind.  The assassin no longer walks
the realm of the living, yet the scar lives on to warn any others who
might wish Borlan harm.  He says, 'Merrick convinced poor innocent
Mish to go into business with him.  I hope he doesn't kill her like
he tried to kill me.'

checks the strings on his lute, and begins to play.

guido lender~
Guido~
Guido, Merrick's cousin and partner, stands here flipping a coin.
~
Guido is smartly dressed in a grey tunic, tight silver trousers, and
a pair of highly polished black boots. He wears a heavy black cloak,
whose bright red silken lining shows briefly as he greets you and asks
you if you want to part with your gold. When you mention that just
maybe you want some of your deposits back, he scowls and tries to
talk you out of it, but finally reluctantly agreeing that if you
really want it (and asked just so) he would have to give it to you.
That admission gained, he seems to be trying to find a way to leave
without being seen, so if you want your money hurry up and ask now!

Day of Thunder, 24th day of the Month of the Dragon, 1010 YH

Tomorrow we leave for the Shadow Grove, the ten of us.  Erinys assures us that
this grove has much natural magic, and we shall again be able to work more
powerful spells than in this miserable city.  We shall raise a new tower
there, and compile a new library of Magecraft.  Alas for the Guild in Thalos
...such horrible loss of knowledge.  750 years of study, gone in a single day
of flame.  Who would have thought that the slaves would revolt? The city
had gone soft on them...treating them as though they were real people, not
the cattle they are.  How dare they burn our city...we who created them!
So few of us survived.  With each year that passes, Mayor Leander listens
to our council less.  We shall see...after we leave we shall see how long
it takes for them to come crawling to us.  We are the last of the Mages of
Thalos, but we will not be taken for granted!

Cyril, Grand Master of Magic.
