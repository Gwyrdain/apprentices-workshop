the rock, this poor man has to clean it up.  He has far more work to
do than he can possibly complete.

princess lay ya~
Princess Lay Ya~
Princess Lay Ya is here, screeching a command & insulted by your presence.
~
She used to be an actual princess, like Snow White, only not quite so
innocent.  Still, she loves being a pretty pretty princess, and she expects
to have her every whim satisfied.

Then her planet went and blew up somehow.  I mean, really, the details
aren't important about how.  But, *BOOM*!

And just like that, she went from pampered princess to everyday refugee
shmoe.

But don't try to tell HER that!  She still thinks very highly of herself,
and she is still demanding.

Such a SPOILED PRINCESS.

So, "Princess" is what people call her to her face... she thinks it is out
of respect, and they think they're being catty, so it works out for
everyone.

"Lay Ya" was a nickname the Princess got in high school.  Kids can be so
mean.  And really, it's none of their business.

Revision Two~
Revision Two is here.
~
This was Luke's second attempt at building a droid.  His first was Gold
Bricker.  It's surprising Luke didn't put his wrenches away forever, but he
thought he could do better.

Not that it would be difficult.

It's a good thing he did.  This squat droid is really the only rebel with a
clue about what's going on, and is always saving the rebels' proverbial
bacon.  But R2 is not talking.

Entrance to the Debt Star~
[In order to avoid the wrath of a certain litigious "mighty" mouse with an
army of lawyers that now own a certain franchise and who would surely care
about a text game in a galaxy far, far away... this may or may not resemble
something you may or may not recognize.]

You have been transported to the Debt Star, a defensive base for the lawful
government.  It has recently been infiltrated by treasonous rebels.  This
civil war must be brought to an end!

The Debt Star is an impressive structure, so named because of the
construction costs, as well as necessary operating expenses, such as
personnel and equipment.  And the power requirements?  Oy.  It ain't cheap
creating your own massive planet-destroying defensive structure, if even
you run an empire and can print your own money.
