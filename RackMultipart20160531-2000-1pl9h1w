Description
The Te'nayu'ka is a sailing vessel under the command of Captain Ak'ash'eck.
Built to transport fragile goods and land-bound passengers across and below
the waves, it is a unique creation, using the technologies developed by the
gnomes of Barbegazi and manned by the fearsome sahuagins of Tiren's Rock. A
smart passenger will remain in the berth provided, as wandering about would
be unwise. Solidarity and teamwork keep a crew safe when traversing the sea,
and this crew is experienced in repelling pirates and Tempest alike. With a
journey that spans the three continents, one should be patient while on the
Te'nayu'ka, but know that the Captain and her crew will get to port safely.

Captain Ak'ash'eck sahuagin~
Captain Ak'ash'eck~
Pearl insignia on the dorsal fin of this sahuagin declares her the captain.
~
Ak'ash'eck is a fearsome example of a sahuagin. Healed scars are displayed
proudly, evidence of her legendary fight against the Terror of the Sea. An
ornate badge of shell and pearl affixed to her dorsal fin shows her rank:
captain of this ship and sole authority aboard the Te'nayu'ka. Her grayish
scales glitter like crushed pearls and her webbed hands and feet end in 
claws that would be the pride of any dragon. Truly, Ak'ash'eck is a marine
force to be reckoned with.

Ta'ke'shi'ka-ga the cook~
Talons wet with tuna gore, Ta'ke'shi'ka-ga prepares a meal for the captain.
~
The leftmost talon of this sahuagin's right hand is extremely long and 
razor-sharp, tipped in metal.  She uses it as a knife to slice open the 
carcasses of the fish she is preparing for the captain's next meal.  An
economy of motion characterizes her every movement - deft, deliberate,
and swift - as she prepares the next culinary adventure.

To'lot'zin, the Master at Arms~
This massive sahuagin could only be To'lot'zin, the Master at Arms.
~
The hulking figure of the sahuagin before you is nearly the size of a young
aquadragon. Vicious claws terminate his powerful arms and legs and his tail
ends in long, sharp spikes tipped with ichor. His eyes scan constantly, the
slightest threat measured and acted upon with the violence he is known for.

Ak'cha'mahez helmsman sahuagin~
the helmsman, Ak'cha'mahez~
Rumors abound that Ak'cha'mahez got the post of helmsman due to familial bonds.
~
Not an impressive specimen of his race, Ak'cha'mahez has a certain cowardly
air about him. His bulbous yellow eyes flicker this way and that, watching 
for any sign that one of the more aggressive members of the crew might take
a bite out of his dull grey hide. His webbed hands are long and nimble, an
asset when working the delicate controls of the Te'nayu'ka.

Bu'lokcha'ban~
Bu'lokcha'ban moves quickly about his tasks as a sailor on the Te'nayu'ka.
~
It is his hard work, and not any family connections, that got Bu'lokcha'ban
his post here on the Te'nayu'ka. He is a hard working soul, going about his
tasks in a timely and conscientious manner.  He considers his shipmates his 
family - replacing the one lost in an attack on Tiren's Rock by the Terror 
of the Sea.

Hurrying along the passageway, Q'u'ma'taz goes about his duties.
~
This sahuagin has a very distinct striping along his sides and his gills 
are a gleaming green. He is of average size for his race, if a bit more 
quick and nimble in his movements. A small oval of coral affixed to his
dorsal ridge marks him as a sailor aboard the Te'nayu'ka.

Chac'u'yab ballast master sahuagin~
Chac'u'yab the ballast master~
Manning the ballast chamber is Chac'u'yab's job.
~
The forearms and shoulders of this sahuagin are massive - easily twin to
those of a minotaur or even an ogre. This comes from his primary task: a
swift release or loading of ballast to control the horizontal movement of
the Te'nayu'ka through the water. Chac'u'yab - or Chac, as he is most often
called - is a good-natured creature, dedicated to his job. His coloring is
nearly a twin to that of a shark: a pale, dull grey, with only a hint of 
green tint to his gills.

Bo'lan'ti'ku~
Shackles bind the arms of this disgraced sahuagin prisoner.
~
Caught derelict at her post, Bo'lan'ti'ku awaits her fate in the brig of 
the Te'nayu'ka. One eye is badly swollen and bloodied and her dorsal fin
is raggedly torn, revealing that the Master at Arms was not gentle when 
placing her under arrest. Thin and gaunt, it is clear that Bo'lan'ti'ku
is not receiving rations while here in the brig.

A clamshell insignia on his dorsal fin marks Ix'il'iton as the ship's healer.
~
Tiny seed pearls decorate the shell upon Ix'il'iton's dorsal fin, the mark
of his rank as ship's healer. His family is a wealthy one and he could not
help but use any opportunity to remind his fellow shipmates that he is here
from choice, not need. His lordly air keeps his fanged snout pointed upward,
and he is the first to point out that his coloring is that of the noble house
of Tiren's Rock.

~
Ah'mu'zen'ka is not only in charge of tracking and documenting every crate,
barrel or package aboard the Te'nayu'ka being shipped, but also all of the
supplies needed by its crew. The placement of every parcel is important, 
as it can affect the ballast needs of the ship. Ah'mu'zen'ka takes his job
very seriously, memorizing the statistics of each load.

Few things are as dangerous as a sahuagin that has been awoken unexpectedly.
This crew member, having recently completed a double shift, shows the signs
that reveal exhaustion in his race: a dulling of the color around his gills,
the drooping of his dorsal crest, and a reddening of the secondary lid
membranes of his eyes.

her task to ensure the cargo nets are bound down tightly, preventing loads
from shifting.

This bristlemouth specimen is vastly larger than most of its kind.
~
This fish is named for its mouth full of odd, equally-sized and
bristle-like teeth. A normal specimen is the size of an human's foot, 
but this monstrous creature is easily triple that. A line of green
light-producing photophores is visible along the underside of its 
body, bright against the coal black of its scaled body. Its tail is 
short and stubby, much like the small fins along its sides. For all 
its odd appearance, this creature has a vicious bite.

long, lean body. Its dorsal fin is long and spike-like, and a light-producing
organ at its tip lures in its prey. One of the most fierce predators of the
deep sea - that isn't a sahuagin - the viperfish uses its fang-like teeth
to tear its prey... and it isn't picky about what it devours.

With his huge, bulbous, golden eyes, Ix'uq'tab keeps a keen look-out through
the murky waters. The threat of Tempest and Terror combine to ensure he does
not falter in his duties. He takes pride in his abilities and contribution to
the ship's safe passage.

this merchant a rich woman, once they get back to Safehaven and her wares

trip down to the hold to check on her treasures reveals the same: it has
been well stowed, carefully tied down, and is being treated with care.

Heading home to D'or D'Terraithe after heated mercantile negotiations in
Safehaven, this drow sits apart from the other passengers, keeping wholly
to himself. His cloak is wrapped around him, a barrier against the chill
of the sea that permeates the vessel, and his eyes are partially closed,
though out of boredom or true weariness, you cannot tell. His white hair
is close-cropped upon his head, and his hands have far more scars than a
simple merchant might reasonably have. He seems wary even at rest, as if
his life has been one of conflicts more dangerous than the price of silk.

a sea-sick gnome passenger~
His skin a pasty yellow, a stout gnome clings tightly to a wooden bucket.
~
Gnomes are not meant to be sea-faring creatures, and while this fellow
was warned, he did not realize the full extent of the misery he would 
be enduring on this trip until it was too late. It is apparent that 
he has been regularly emptying the contents of his small stomach, as a
miasma of vomit surrounds him and the bucket he clings desperately to.
Still, as sick as he is, this does not look like a gnome to trifle 
with. He has a very soldierly bearing about him and an awareness, even 
in his misery, of everything around him.

With eyes that are entirely out of scale with the rest of its body, 
taking up nearly half its head, this lanternfish is an odd-looking

They illuminate the murky water of the bilge, luring in its prey.

under its large eyes glow eerily in the dark murky water of the bilge.

in his faded brown hair as bends his head to examine the tickets held in

bucket~
This is a very nice bucket. The workmanship is good, with wooden lathes
fitted tightly together, bound with some sort of dark metal. It looks
like the sort of bucket that would be useful for swabbing a deck or
scrubbing flooring. Unfortunately, it has been put to less pleasant
uses of late.

The Te'nayu'ka is a unique vessel, constructed of the bones of the

by the depredations of the Tempest. This specimen's flexible skeleton
was used as the foundation of the submarine, constructed for over or
under water operation by the sahuagins of Tiren's Rock. Perhaps you 
should come aboard and explore!

The Tower of the Te'nayu'ka~ 
Portals above and below allow vertical access into the depths of the ship
and out to the ocean's wild waves. This structure is oddly organic - made 
of a flexible whalebone-like material, rather than hard metal. Designs of
spirals and branches, resembling shells and corals, decorate the interior
surface and growths that closely resemble barnacles provide handholds for
those not blessed with fins to traverse.

A clear screen of crystal provides a perfect view of the surroundings here
on the bridge of the Te'nayu'ka. Beyond that barrier, sea creatures dart
out of the way, their movement stirring the kelp that drifts by. Here on 
the bridge, crew members go about their tasks. An old-fashioned ship's 
wheel has been plucked up from some ancient wreck and re-used as part of 
the navigation system. A rack of charts covers the entirety of the port
side of the bridge.

This vessel is made of some sort of strange, flexible, whalebone-like
material, that feels oddly disconcerting underfoot. To the north, the
open archway of the bridge can be seen, and to the east, tantalizing 
scents of fish waft forth. A closed door bars the way to the officers'
quarters to the west and the passageway continues the length of the 
vessel to the south.

This section of the vessel seems almost coral-like, with openings in
every direction. Below, a gaping bore leads to the hold, and above 
lies the fairwater. A wide passageway allows movement to the north,
in the direction of the bridge, and south, towards the stern. A door
bars the way to the west, a sign upon it reading "Passengers' Quarters",
and to the east, a sign upon that door reads "Mess Hall".

almost like a trampoline. This gangway extends towards the stern and 
bow, and closed doors block entry to the crew quarters, located to the 
port and starboard.

It is bare of ornamentation and not well-traveled. The surface of 
the walls, ceiling and floor is pale, and oddly flexible to the

This is obviously the quarters of one who is neat and organized - almost

no luxury here or ostentatious display.  All of the furniture is simple:
a knotted sleeping-net, a plain wooden desk, a small chest of drawers. A
small, rusted metal anchor hanging on the wall is the chamber's sole form 
of ornamentation. A stout portal blocks the way to the south and a hatch
grants entry to the bridge above.

Padding has been lashed around a series of crates, to prevent any jostling
of the precious and fragile contents of the pallet that rests here in the 
center of the forward hold. A peek in between the slats of the wooden boxes
reveals a large quantity of very old looking bottles of wine. Each appears 
to be destined for a different port and their presence here in the forward
hold is indicative of the care that Ah'mu'zen'ka, the cargo master, is 
taking with their condition.

A complex latticework of boards and timbers, ropes and pulleys is piled here.
It appears to be some sort of complex machinery, perhaps destined for the

levers and blowers to inflate and deflate it. How the crew of the Te'nayu'ka
managed to get it into the hold in one piece is a marvel in and of itself.

from under the canvas and the load shifts slightly as whatever is within 
its confines tries to get out.

Even the floor is graced with a rug to provide a spot of color and comfort.

a spider sigil upon the seal and warding spells - obviously a fabric
of the greatest of value.

This small, barren room has no comforts whatsoever. The sole furniture is
a rusty bucket in one corner, rank and foul with excrement. This room has
been carefully reinforced, with additional cross-wise beams of the soft,
cartilage-like material the ship is crafted of, to ensure any prisoner in
here is unable to escape. The single exit, a door to the west, has only a
small peep-hole perhaps a hand-span wide, barely large enough to shove a 
puny fish steak through or glance in to check on a prisoner.

Some of the barrels appear to have been moved slightly, creating a small

collects that is used on board, whether for cleaning or cooking and also
where the latrines empty. The smell is a noxious and pungent assault. A 
thick layer of green scum-like algae can be seen floating over most of 
the water, which has a surprisingly strong tidal movement that corresponds 
to the passage of the ship. The bilge extends to the north and a closed 
hatch leads upward to the main hold.

In the Bilge~
The smell here in the bilge is an overwhelmingly noxious and pungent 
assault on your nose. This is where water collects that is used on 
board, for both cleaning and cooking, and where the latrines empty. 
It is nearly hip-deep and icy cold. A layer of foul scum-like algae 
can be seen floating over most of the water, which has a strong tidal 
movement that corresponds to the passage of the ship. The bilge extends 
to the south and north.

The Sea-Lock~
This small chamber is barricaded at both ends and is used for docking 
underwater, providing a chamber to keep the Te'nayu'ka from flooding 
when unloading at Tiren's Rock. Stout doors keep back the waters, an
unbreakable lock on each.

In the Bilge~
Foul smells fill the air of the bilge, making your eyes water. This 
channel at the bottom of the vessel is filled nearly to the ceiling 
with a foul stew of latrine effluvia, dirty water, leakage flow and 
other liquid. It moves back and forth through the bilge with a strong, 
tidal shift, caused by the motion of the Te'nayu'ka through the water.  
Extending to the south and north, this dangerous passageway is actually 
a tiny tidepool-like environment, with fish living in it.

In the Bilge~
The bulkhead stops northward movement through the bilge here, but the
passageway extends to the south. Water fills the space, nearly to the 
ceiling, and its revolting stench is more foul than any rotting heap,
or midden one can find anywhere in the realm.  Several types of fish,
all suited to the deep waters, make the bilge their home, though how
it is they came to be here is anyone's guess.
