Description
The Boneyard was once known as Brookside Memorial, a burial ground for the
richest of the rich, but the mysterious curse that was laid upon it has
stripped away any hint of its past glory and stateliness. More than one
adventurer has attempted to purify the grounds and failed, and what horrors
lurk there, none can say -- for no one who enters, ever leaves.

Justin Wraith~
the wraith of Justin of Rowengard~
His eyes like windows to Hell, Justin of Rowengard wavers here.
~
Justin has the look of one who travels on his wits and survives by his
blade. With his brother Frederick, Justin has traveled all over the
Frontier - and this lifetime of adventure is seen clearly upon his person,
from the distinctively blue-gray mud of the Sava River caking his boots to
the feathered badge pinned to his hat that is surely the craftsmanship of
one from the Aerie. In life, Justin was an attractive, broad shouldered man
with a ready smile, long dark hair bound in a braid down his back, and wide
hands that were as skilled at gentle touch as they were causing mayhem.

Fredrick wraith~
the wraith of Fredrick of Rowengard~
His eyes like windows to Hell, Fredrick of Rowengard wavers here.
~
When he still breathed, Fredrick was a plain but comfortable fellow, and
something about his honest face inspires trust. His armored brigandine is
in the style of the dwarves of Dhuvrad, but surely had to have been
custom-made specifically for him, perhaps as a gift for good deeds done.
Tall and broad shouldered from wielding twin longswords for years, Fredrick
had sandy brown hair and twinkling blue eyes, until the curse was laid and
he passed into this eternal twilight paused between life and death.

One of the famed Sereni Quadruplets of Riverhold, the man before you has
the tanned features and lithe, strong body of someone who spends much of
their time outdoors, in hard labors. His hands bear the callouses of
swordplay but his rolling gait is that of one who spends much time on the
water. An easy smile comes to his wide mouth and his brown eyes hold as
much humor at the jest of the world as it does awareness of its dangers.

place. Delindel is an individual of grace and elegance, and bears some of
the wickedest hazel eyes one can imagine.

it was upon Galandel that the greatest test fell; knowing the best way to
dispel the miasma of evil that lays over the Boneyard. Alas, his faith
failed him at the moment of greatest testing, and he and his friends are
eternally damned.

The figure of an ancient elven woman shimmers before you in wraith form.
~
An elf of great power, Belaraviel and her three partners were hired to find
the missing Riverhold Quadruplets. Alas, the four friends were also caught
up in the horrific magic that binds the dead to a shameful mockery of life
in this place. Belaraviel was the eldest of the four, keeping the lads in
order, fed, rested, and only taking those jobs they were suited for. Her
snow-white hair is bound in a braided coronet, and her garb is soft and
flowing, like the breezes through the Weaver's garden.

A stumpy, stout, spectral dwarf paces here, muttering.
~
Some internal torment wracks this spectral figure as he paces back and 
forth. His posture is proud and strong, mirroring that of the Royal 
Guard he aspired to join, but the anguished expression beneath his
bushy beard reveal a tender heart within the warrior's body. A bit of 
finely crafted leather with gemstone accents, perhaps an arm-band made
by a promised love, is clutched in his hand, as if the sole reminder of
the life he has lost by falling to the curse.

A dwarven wraith stands here inspecting the stonemasonry.
~
Budrik simply wanted to study the architecture of the Tallfolk. That's all.
He wasn't an adventurer out for gold or the thrill of it all. Just an
artist wanting to make his buildings better, taller, stronger. So he hired
Herugrim, whom everyone knew was a tough little dwarf, and off they went.
The Memorial Gardens were pretty famous, and what trouble could they find
in a cemetery, for Wyld's sake? ... Unfortunately, they both found more
trouble than they could handle. Cursed, they have remained here since that
fateful day.

Heart-mate to T'ssarien, S'shathia sorrows at their deaths and binding to
this wretched place so far from the blessed refuge of the sea. Only with a
downpour of rain does she get some sense of home. If only she could feel
that cool, reviving wetness and smell the crispness and succulence of the
falling drops...

Longingly reaching for the waters forever denied her, T'ssarien weeps.
~
Few creatures of land have the grace of the sea-elves within their watery
home. Upon the earth, however, they lose some of that near-mystical
eloquence of movement. The sea-elf before you, however, is downright epic
in the longing and need that flows through her every movement and gesture.
Reaching for the water of the fountain, she weeps ghostly tears as she
longs for the safety and peace of her home in Crescent Moon Bay.

the Lady Who Cuts the Threads, that his will be severed from this place
once and for all. Wisps of white hair cling to his rotting pate, and his
garments, soiled with unmentionable things, nearly fall off his bones.

You have never seen a vulture so enormous. Fattened on the constantly
regenerating flesh of those trapped in this unholy place, this stinking
scavenger can feast as it likes, as long as it likes. So it has - and in
its gorging, has grown to a truly horrific size.

These poor remains were once a knight, a knight turned away from the path
of truth and passion, turned to darkness and brooding. In retribution for
the corruption of his holy oath, Sir Matthew stands here, unable to pass to
the next life, trapped here, entombed.

Cringing against the wall of her crypt, Miralin Salamir prays for mercy.
~
Miralin was once a renowned beauty, and poems were written of the creamy
expanse of her skin, the azure gems of her eyes, the lustrous golden waves
of her hair. All of her physical gifts were what drew her husband to her,
like a stalking wolf to a woodland bunny. Even as a shade, the darkening of
bruises are visible upon her skin, and her jewel-like eyes are haunted and
miserable. Her nails are broken, torn past the quick, in attempts to fend
off her attacker, and her lips move in a constant stream of prayers for
mercy and release.

His eyes filled with painful promises, Carlosanti Salamir approaches you.
~
There is a wicked abandon in the eyes of Carlosanit Salamir - enough to
cause most maidens to cast aside thoughts of saving themselves for marriage
and instead giving their all to this seducer. But if one looks closer at
the curve of his lips, it is not seduction his mouth promises, but the
barbs of cruel mockery. His arms are well-formed, but very thin parallel
scars run all along them as if someone tore at the skin like a maddened,
tormented animal caught in a trap, vainly seeking to defend themselves. His
tall, strong frame is both comely and menacingly capable of overcoming the
struggles of those less powerful.

The wretched remains of Lord Martin looks back at you suspiciously,
staggering a bit. "You're trying to steal my wife, aren't you! Well, I will
not let you! Be off with you!"  With that, he lunges forward, albeit
clumsily, raising his weapon. Alas, Lord Martin couldn't quite understand
the fact that death, for him, is an eternal twilight moment that never
ends. He is still convinced that he is alive, and that the sepulcher that
encloses his remains is the grand home he once shared with his favorite
possession, the Lady Catarina.

the damned soul of Catarina Cuidillero~
Eyes closed, yet body carefully upright, Catarina waits for true death.
~
Her spectral eyes closed, a carefully crafted expression of inoffensive
blandness upon her lovely face, Catarina keeps herself composed and silent
as a statue. When she is thus, her husband by arranged marriage sometimes
forgets to vent his spleen upon her. While no bruises flower upon her
delicate skin, Catarina is proof that some mortal wounds are entirely of
the heart and soul. A simple locket around her throat bears the family seal
of a modest mercantile family out of Rowen Docks. The lavishness of her
clothing is a stark contrast that hints the family patriarch sold her to
the Cuidilleros as a bride to increase their own standing and fortunes.

Vaedry, once a respected sorcerer, is quite aware of the binding upon his
soul. He has tested the spell many, many times, to no avail. The only
momentary surcease is that short span of hours between his death at the
hands of adventurers, and the hour of midnight, when the spell is
reactivated and he rises again, spirit bound to rotting flesh.

Dark eyes meet yours with a knowing wink, and the expression upon the
rotted face before you smirks of a self-image and ego stronger than most. 
But then, he was THE Gregory Ventani... and was not inclined to let anyone
ever forget it!  (Of course, he was the only person in history to be slain
by a poisonous weasel dropped down his trousers, so one takes their claims
to fame where they can find them...)

 The fearsome zombie of Sir Brandon stands here.
~
In life, he was probably handsome, deft, and intelligent.  But Death does
not allow those in Her grasp to retain such gifts.  She has simply left him
hate - hate for all that lives. Her only other gift is a cunning and skill
at mayhem that even She could not quench or calm. Brandon Ventani was one
of the most famous of all duelists at one point. His services on behalf of
a slighted nobleman fetched prices of well over fifty thousand gold. And a
mere trifle of an adventurer such as you? Barely worth bothering with.

It is an accident that Candido Ventani was buried here. His wishes were
quite explicit: Burial within the loving arms of the sea he traveled most
of his adult life. But he died, not in service on a ship, but in a filthy
hostel, coughing up blood from a disease given to him by a waterfront
whore. His shipmates were not by him to speed him to the Lord of the Sea's
gracious halls... instead, his rotting remains were sent home to the family
plot, just in time for the curse to be laid.

Therese Ventani was a shrew in life. Death has just made it worse.

Her sharp, narrow features are curved in a perpetual expression of loathing
and spite. An old maid who died unloved and alone, Therese Ventani was not
mourned by anyone. No one save the groundskeeper witnessed her body's final
sleep within the mausoleum. Now that she has visitors, at last there is a
target for her vitriol.

Oh, he was such a ladies man - just ask him. Of course, the women loathed
and despised his crude comments, the lustful grabbings and gropings down
bodices and up skirts. They hated the way his eyes gloated of the perverse
debaucheries he would enjoy forcing upon them. They all whispered and hoped
for the day he would die for the way he would take them, hurt them, beat
them. Somewhere, those women are rejoicing that their prayers were
answered.

~
The virtuoso skill of Perrion Ventani was renowned. He played for the
pleasure of mighty lords, ladies, kings.. even the Patroness of Bards, if
the rumors be true. In some ways, Perrion did not play music - he became
music, his entire being transformed by the beauty of the sounds that flowed
forth through his hands. Here, the only music is that of the wind in the
trees, or the cries of the damned.

the damned soul of Noshan Tirenas~
With a cold sneer, Noshan Tirenas expresses his hate for all life.
~
Not an attractive man in life, Death has been even more unkind to Noshan
Tirenas.  Still garbed in his finest doeskin trousers and velvet coat, his
flesh bears the unkind marks of his brutal death at the claws and teeth of
his usually obedient - if a bit enthusiastic - hunting dogs, Syrek and
Mylo.

This fellow has definitely seen better days. His eyes are empty, staring

Lots of men. Any kind of men. Noble, ruffian, merchant, thief, human,

perform. Death has been remarkably unkind to this woman, leaving her only

only the gods' blessings can save you from his horrific need, desire, and

indifferent woman to notice this beautiful young courtier.  But alas, that
was in life. In death, Mikhail is something out of nightmare, out of the
dreams that make us fear the setting of the sun and the blanket of sleep.

Perhaps it was an unholy pact with equally unholy powers or darkest
sorcery, but the undead creature before you retains all of the beauty that
her mortal form held and none of the usual terror of the Kindred - which
she most certainly is.  Dark chestnut hair cascades down to the middle of
her back, save one lock, which she twirls around her finger in a playful
gesture.  Brilliant and luminous as sapphires, her eyes are not nearly so
cold or hard, as they peruse you with keen attention. Her voice is low and
husky, as she smiles teasingly, barely flashing ivory fangs, and invites,
"Stay with me a while?"

predator's gleam illuminates his sapphire-bright eyes and a smirk curls up

angular artistry of his face stand out clearly and starkly. His shoulders,
broad and strong, add to his sense of presence, contrasting narrow hips. A
languid gesture of his hand indicates you should come closer.

she clutches at a holy medallion around her throat, to ward off the evil
magics here.  Her figure is pleasantly curvy, her pale hair bound back in a
sensible braid. She is dressed for travel, with practical leathers and
heavy wools, with an old but serviceable dagger at her hip. She has not yet
been affected by the magics of the Boneyard, and is trying to search the

ground, and threaten with its strong, pincer-like jaws.  Although it has no
stinger, this beetle can give a painful bite! It also emits a foul smelling
odor, as a defensive secretion, from a pair of white glands at the end of
its abdomen.  It prefers to stay hidden when it isn't feeding, and the
blanket of leaves covering the graveyard provide it perfect cover.

they are sliding down one hip, revealing a series of evenly spaced crimson
welts. Obviously fearful for his life, given his location in a

Four slashes of white clay upon his cheek and hair spiked upward into
points with the red earth of his home, this orc shaman is here to
investigate, research, and collect what he can. The potency of the risen
dead in this place would be a powerful weapon to lay at the feet of Aramat,
and he is here to wrest the secrets of the curse from the inhabitants, the
grave soil, even the air, of the Boneyard, if need be.

Cleverly designed with a hinge on one side so that it can be opened in the
center, this dollhouse is a marvel of craftsmanship. It appears to have
been designed to resemble a very specific house, as the color palette is in
the rich tones of the House Salamir and the door bears the stag and star
emblem. The dollhouse has a total of fourteen rooms, four floors, and
twenty eight glass windows, seven of which are missing. From the individual
slate tiles of the roof to the marvels of miniature work paintings hanging
on the walls, this doll house was clearly a very expensive gift to a very
loved child.

Before a Dilapidated Cemetery~
The brambles lie thick and close, crowding the broken remains of the road.
To the south lie a pair of wrought iron, arching, spike-topped iron gates
that weep scarlet tears of rust. They stand guard between the route back to
Rowengard and the many graves that lay beyond, like the dark, bloody
guardians of the path to the Underworld. The cemetery appears to have once
been quite rich and lavish, the private resting place of a few wealthy
families, perhaps. The sign upon the gates reads "Brookside Memorial", but
someone has stuck a painted bit of weathered canvas upon the fence nearby,
which reads, "The Boneyard. Step carefully, lest your bones join those of
the folk entombed here..."

This is the north-west corner of the graveyard. To one side are the metal
bars of the gates that halt entry into the memorial, and to the other, the
crumbling, vine-covered stone wall that enclose the other three sides of
the area. The grass is long and silky here, well fed by the dew that seeps
down the gate and wall. The strands twine up the bars of the wrought iron
fence like lover's hair through fingers. Cobblestones beneath your feet,
mostly buried in the grass and earth, form a path leading to the east and
south.

You stand beneath the sheltering branches of a huge pine tree which reach
out in a canopy over the broken cobblestone pathway along the ancient 
crypts.  The tree's branches bow down almost to the ground, and look quite
sturdy - you have no fear that they would break under your weight. The 
towering giant looks to be at least one hundred years old, perhaps older, 
and in its higher branches, movement can be seen here and there as wild 
creatures scamper within its shelter. The path leads to the east and west.

This is the wide, central corridor of the memorial garden. It was once
paved in perfect, round cobblestones, but alas, they are broken, buried,
and hidden beneath the long, flowing grass. From this vantage, you can
clearly see the rows of weathered and beaten buildings, once graceful
enclosures for the beloved dead. The structures appear to be newer towards
the front of the graveyard, and older towards the back. Trees dot the park
here and there, and in the center is a huge oak and what appears to be a
fountain of some sort. The exit lies to the north. To the south is the
graveyard's center. To the east and west, the cobblestones disappear into
the long grass and overgrowth.

A pine tree towers over head, its far-reaching branches blocking out some
of the view of the sky. The cobblestones under foot are broken, moss and
grass outlining the cracks in the stones. Brown pine needles liberally
scatter the ground, dropped by the giant tree that towers above. The path
leads to the east and west, following rows of mausoleums.

The thin, dry, grayish-green grass here is tall and blows in the wind,
making a soft, scratching noise against your garments. The sound is eerie,
almost like that of fleshless fingers scrabbling upon stone. A shoulder-
high stone fence squats in the swaying greenery, nearly buried in the sea
of grass, revealing the eastern boundary of the Boneyard. The path extends
to the west and south.

The path seems almost like a channel of sea-water, the way the tall grass
sways and sweeps in complex patterns, teased by the breeze. Protected by
the wall to the west, which shelters it from the strong winds that rip
through the rest of the graveyard, and granted the dew that slides down the
wall's stone surface, the grass here is luxuriously verdant, almost enough
to make one wish to go barefoot. The trail through the Boneyard runs to the
north, south, and east. To the south and slightly to the west, the arched
dome of a building is visible.

The central aisle of the graveyard, this pathway shows the same destruction
as others within these grounds. Nearly as wide as an ogre is tall, it was 
once paved in perfect, round cobblestones. Now, they are shattered by time
and the seasons, hidden beneath the long, wispy grass. In the intermediate
directions, you can see weathered and beaten crypts. The structures appear

The exit lies to the north. To the south is the graveyard's center, where a

beneath the pine, some disturbed by the passage of creatures through the

against your clothing, making an eerie sighing sound that might be found
disturbing by less bold individuals. The pathway leads to the north,
towards the exit, to the south, deeper into the graveyard, and to the west,
along a row of sad, ill-maintained mausoleums. The well-picked carcass of
an unusually large raven lays in the midst of the path just a few steps
away, a grisly reminder that many of the creatures found here have unending
hunger.

A graceful walkway extends from this point to the west, towards what is a
fairly ominous example of architecture - a cathedral made of dark stones,
with jutting spires and leering gargoyles. Its design could not be called
welcoming. The main pathway of the Boneyard extends from north to south,
and another lane disappears into the swaying grass to the east. The
half-eaten carcass of a dog lies here, a crow perched upon its shoulder,
happily pecking away at the rotted flesh.

ground like a court lady's skirts. Within its higher branches, movement can

The ornate marble fountain before you has seen better days.  Of course,
everything here seems to be in the same sorry state as the fountain. The
huge circular pale marble edifice fills the meeting of the pathways within
the Boneyard. An external wall surrounds the water-work, and it is sculpted
to look like a rocky shore. A graceful mermaid sits upon a stone in the
center of the fountain, an arc of brackish water still trickling from her
outstretched hands into the water below. Crafted of bronze, she is stained
verdigris green, and marked by the droppings of birds. Above you, the wide
open arms of a massive, ancient oak tree spread.

Pine needles lay thickly underfoot - both fresh deep green and dead, russet
orange, their source one of the many tall pine trees that line the pathways
in the cemetery.  Something has been moving in the tree tops, disrupting
the branches, it seems, causing the needles to fall. The lane upon which
you stand runs from the east to the west, and stone mausoleums can be seen
to each of the non-cardinal directions.  The central point of the graveyard

The breeze teases its way through the tall, spindly grass that grows in and
among the broken cobblestones of the pathway. It stretches from north to
south along the low, stone wall that encloses the Boneyard. Here, the wall
jogs outward, surrounding a small stone structure to the east. It doesn't
look like a mausoleum, but its true purpose is not immediately apparent.
The path extends in all four cardinal directions. Midair, a dark feather
wafts back and forth in the wind, cast off by one of the vultures that are
prevalent here.

Stretching skyward, a pine tree partially blocks the path. One of many that
line the lanes within the Boneyard, it looks old and sturdy, easily able to
hold your weight.  Cast off pine needles litter the ground, their rusty
color making it look like blood pools between the broken cobbles of the
path. Something rustles in the pine's upper branches, hinting that
something else may have sought shelter there. In each of the non-cardinal
directions, you can see the mausoleums that make this graveyard famous. The
path runs to the east and west.

The structures are old in this, the back half of the graveyard, the rock
walls faded and bleached by the sun, and stained with the marks of birds
and plant growth creeping over their walls. Crumbling bits of stone litter
the pathway, making footing treacherous. The wind picks up, pulling at your
garments and making the trees creak and groan like living things. To the
north, you can see the path leading to the central courtyard, and all the
way in the distant south, a mausoleum that dwarfs all the others is the
terminal point of the lane.

On a Path in the Boneyard~
You stand beneath a pine tree; one of many planted here ages ago in stately
rows along the lanes of the graveyard. Its branches stretch out in a canopy
over the broken cobblestone pathway between the ancient crypts. The
towering giant looks to be at least one hundred years old, perhaps older,
and in its higher branches, movement can be seen. It looks easily strong
enough to hold your weight, should you wish to climb up. The tree's needles
scatter the ground, covering it in a blanket of burnt orange and brown,
nearly hiding every hint of the cobblestone pathway that runs from east to
west.

On a Path in the Boneyard~
A short, squat stone fence is nearly hidden in the sea of tall grasses that
overgrow the pathway here. The wall forms the eastern boundary of the
Boneyard. To the north-east, a small, utilitarian structure can be seen,
but it doesn't resemble expensive mausoleums found elsewhere. The path
extends to the west and north. Something rotting and recently dead fouls
the air to the south.

On a Path in the Boneyard~
This is the south-western corner of the graveyard, and the low stone walls
that enclose it come to a meeting point here. Wide pathways lead both north
and east, nearly overrun with tall, wispy grasses that have squirmed their
way up between the broken cobblestones. From this vantage, you can see the
towering spires of a cathedral to the north-west, and a gargantuan
mausoleum complex to the southeast. Something squishes underfoot, and to
your disgust, you realize you have just stepped in a rotting gobbet of
flesh, dropped by some carrion-eater.

On a Path in the Boneyard~
This east-west pathway is the southern-most and oldest portion of the
graveyard. There is little to no trace of cobblestones or gravel beneath
the tall, wispy grass. Debris scatters the lane as the mausoleums crumble
from the weight of time, and the encroachment of the roots of the towering
pine trees that dot the pathways. Footing underfoot is perilous to say the
least. To the east and west, this walkway continues, or an adventurous soul
could climb up into the ancient tree that reaches skyward.

Standing Before an Ancient Mausoleum~
Obviously one of the oldest tombs here, the ancestral tomb complex you
stand before is the epitome of deteriorating grandiosity. The grey stone
crumbles a bit more before your eyes as the winds rush over it, casting a
fine, powdery layer of stone dust over the grass. Only the metal plaque
that once arched gracefully above the lintel remains of its original
beauty, although it lays haphazardly upon the ground. The door doesn't seem
particularly stable or safe. Entering this crypt would be a bad idea, as
exit is certainly not guaranteed.

A host of angels and magical symbols cover this decorative brass plaque
which once hung above the doorway into the mausoleum. It seems strange 
that the symbols are ones of warding, and the angelic host appears to be 
commanding the onlooker to turn away. The name upon the plaque reads:

.                          FAMILIA VON HAROVICH                           .

Towering pines line the grassy walkways between the mausoleums. In this,
the oldest part of the graveyard, they are massive giants, their
outstretched limbs spanning the full distance between the rows of crypts.
Their branches are strong, if sticky with hardened sap, and it would be
easy to climb up for a different vantage. To the south, the low stone wall
that encloses the graveyard blocks your ability to travel in that
direction. To the east and west, the pathway continues, winding as it does
through the mausoleums.

The south-eastern corner of the graveyard is marked by the meeting of the
low stone and mortar wall that encloses it from the north and west. An
empty, leering humanoid skull rests atop the wall, set there by some
unknown individual in a moment of humor. Long grass swirls and eddies in
each dancing movement of the breeze, made thick and lush by the extra
moisture created by the condensation on the stone wall. The barest hint of
a cobblestone path leads off to the north, and grass and rubble combine to
form a perilous trail to the west.

In A Small Shed~
With walls so cracked and warped you can see the tombs outside, this shed
has not weathered the years well. The wooden boards that make up its worn
construction are weathered and twisted with age, and any trace of paint is
long since gone. Piles of tools in the corner reveal that this was probably
a caretaker's tool shed. They are long since rusted to uselessness. Dusty
and torn spider webs cover much of the walls and ceiling, clear evidence
that no one has disturbed this place for decades. A few birds have made
their neat and tidy nests in the eaves of the shed, providing a curious
juxtaposition to the overall sense of age, death and decay the shed
projects.

For all of the gloom of the Boneyard below, the view up in the pine tree 
is one of eerie beauty. Above the tops of even the tallest of the crypts

with a sense of unearthly mystery. Oddly enough, although they are not

made its own paths through the graveyard, slipping from crypt to crypt,

The height of this tree provides a fine vantage point to view the cathedral
building that lies to the west beyond the wall. It is a vast, brooding hulk
of stone, with a central oculus of some bizarre gray material. From portico
to apse, the structure stretches nearly seven hundred feet, and the dome is
pierced by the openings of a clerestory two hundred feet from the cathedral
floor. A pair of flanking side-buildings hunch next to the main body of the
building, and all in all, the place looks downright eerie.

The pathway has lead you to yet another tomb, crafted long ago of finely
veined marble. Made to weather time and the wind and rain, it has done so
admirably. Unfortunately, it bears the marks of deliberate assault and
defacement. Rude comments have been painted upon the walls that cast slurs
upon the one sleeping within. Large chunks of stone are missing here and 
there where the edifice itself was attacked in anger and rage. An inept
attempt at lock-picking the massive door resulted in the mechanism being
smashed in with a piece of fallen masonry. A plaque above the door names
the disliked one interred here. The path runs east and west.

those who treasured them, or perhaps a husband's last wish to honor his
beloved wife.  An oval plaque of time-stained silver engraved with roses

of its grandeur and indulgent luxury to the south. Painted gilt-work
ornaments the gold-veined creamy marble blocks that make up the mausoleum.
Stained glass windows provide color, but are protected by ornate metal
grillwork. All of the workmanship is quite fine, but the overall image is
one of prideful boasting.  A golden plaque further proclaims the one buried

entryway, tokens of esteem from lovers separated by the vast emptiness of
death. The structure itself is ornate, looking more like a gentleman's

Boxy in shape, bare of pillars, preventives, oculi, runes, sigils, or
any other manner of decoration, it quite resembles the soul it houses 
for the remainder of time: un-ostentatious, down to earth, and calm. 
A ship's wheel plaque has been painted upon the door, marking this tomb's 
owner as one who gave the God of the Sea his allegiance. The path continues

This tomb has been desecrated and bears the unmistakable signs of being the
subject of a great deal of rage. Shattered bottles of wine litter the earth
at the building's base, and chips here and there mark where stones have
been cast. All of the windows are broken, and in some spots, smears of a
dark brown stain the pale stone of the crypt, as if fists had been pounded
bloody against the walls, or something foul was smeared. Traces of soot
around the windows reveal that at some point, the structure was put to the
torch. A plain stone plaque above the door names the one buried here. The
path continues to the east and west.

To the south lies a building more suitable to a Garden of Earthly Delights
than to a graveyard. It is built to resemble a lady's bower, and is highly
ornamented and decorated (by someone of questionable taste, one might add).
Frescoes of naked cherubs flitting here and there chasing coy, voluptuous
nymphs garbed in translucent garb cover the walls. In the artwork, a
voluptuous, stunningly sensual woman reclines upon a pillow-covered divan
as she observes the debauchery. Stained glass windows provide an additional
level of wealth and luxury. An etched mirrored glass plaque names the one

Standing Before a Mausoleum~
This tomb is very lovely, if such a structure can be described thus.
Crafted with elegance and good taste, it seems at odds with the ostentation
and bragging found on the other sepulchers within the Memorial Garden. A
plaque above the door names the one interred here.  The path continues east
and west.

Built for one of the scions of House Salamir, this luxurious stone chamber
is crafted of finely veined gray marble. The door is flanked with the
crumbled remains of blue velvet curtains, their dusty fuzziness enough to
make one's nose twitch. At the center of the crypt is a platform of a

upon each.  Metal sconces hang from the walls, unlit torches set within
them. Ornate pillars carved like caryatids dot the floor, reaching up to

caboshed and in chief three mullets Or, is displayed upon a shield hanging
on the southern wall, as well as on the bier supporting the central coffin.

The quiet and chill of this chamber is a marked change from the outdoors.
Crafted of stone but paneled in a dark wood, it is ornamented with a small
shrine to the God Maurice. The altar is littered with small trinkets and
other offerings, all of which are coated in dust. The floor underfoot is a
dark slate, each slab carefully fitted to the next in an example of fine
workmanship. To either side of the chamber, dark stone platforms bear stone
coffins, each carved with the image of the one resting within - the one to
the east bears the visage of an autocratic noble, his face stern and
commanding. The one to the west is carved in the image of a gentle lady.

upon the southern wall.

is livened by touches of a deep, passionate purple. It billows in the form
of rotted curtains to either side of the entryway, and is draped over the
stone sarcophagus that sits in the center of the mausoleum. The remnants of
a thickly piled rug covers the floor. A carved trellis of heavy roses
arches over the entryway. A comfortable wooden chair, now fragile with age,
sits in one corner, as if the one entombed here expected lamenting

This chamber looks as much like a gentleman's salle, as it does anything
else. An entire wall has been made of polished metal, to provide a mirror.
It reflects the weapons racks upon the opposite wall, where the tools of a
duelist are proudly displayed. The wooden floor is polished, and light
could be provided by both sconces on the wall and a bronze chandelier
hanging from the ceiling. The stone coffin is non-descript, placed against
the south wall, almost as if in afterthought. A crimson crystal chalice is
now only filled with dust, where once it held the finest vintages of wine,
where it rests upon the coffin. The Ventani crest - a golden lily upon a
black background within a golden border - is displayed prominently upon a
shield hanging above the coffin, on the goblet laying on the floor, and
engraved upon the cup hilts of the swords hanging upon the walls.

Simple and unassuming, this stone structure has been completely paneled on
the interior with wood seasoned by the seas. You can still discern traces
of the salt that soaked into the timbers for decades, when the timbers
re-purposed here were the hull of a ship. An anchor, the name 'Taaut's
Prize' still visible upon it, rests in one corner. The shredded remains of
a linen hammock lay in tatters against the walls, where time and humidity
have caused the fibers to rot. The sole window looks out to the north, it's

manner of creatures adorn the floors, covering it a thick pile: minotaur,
lion, centaur, and baby dragon. A heavy leather chair is adorned with the
Tirenas family crest: Sable, a sword bendwise sinister argent, a thickly
cushioned footrest before it. Weapons of all sorts are displayed on
individual hangers upon the walls. The coffin is nearly hidden behind a
large display of a stuffed Tiger.

This vaulted, circular crypt is plain and without ornament. It is only
after a moment's study that you realize that what you first took for a
raised dais with a throne-like chair upon it, is, in fact, a sarcophagus. A
lifelike carving of a death's head raven clings to the raised back of the
chair, and the moth-eaten remains of a raven-feather rug covers a part of
the floor. Narrow arrow-slit style windows create the ability to view the
entire graveyard, one glimpse at a time.

to walk in a plain wooden casket and leave it behind. A metal plaque still

Great violence was done to this building: At some point, if the evidence of
your eyes is to be believed, it was set ablaze. All within it is charred
ruin, but even still, you can pick out some details as to what the chamber
might have looked like: The 'coffin' for eternal rest is carved to look
like a divan, as if the one within it was just emerging satiated from an
evening's pleasure. Shards of glass reveal the expensive decanters that
once made up a wealthy man's personal bar, and a thick layer of ash on the
floor bears witness to the luxurious sheepskins that once covered the stone
underfoot.

ornamentation. Light streams in through the leaded glass windows,
illuminating the tableau. With a large, four poster canopy bed instead of a
coffin, a mirrored dresser, and a mouse-eaten chaise lounge, it is clear
the sort of activities that the occupant most earnestly pursued. Though it
has been decades since the one entombed here was laid to rest, the scent of
cloying perfume still scents the air. The sad remains of a small lap-dog,
abandoned here when his mistress died, are visible at the foot of the bed.

This is the central corridor of the graveyard, and it is clear that no
expense was neglected in its initial manufacture. Wide slabs of marble once
made up the pathway, but now, all of the stones are shattered and in
disrepair. Sickly yellow weeds and dry, sharp grass sprawl out between the
pavers. A lone beetle makes its slow way along, industriously heading
south, to where a massive oak spreads its arms in haven and welcome. To the
north lies the entryway.

with the shifting soil. A clump of dandelions brings an unexpected spot of

lies to one side of the corridor. Flies circle it, the buzzing of their

east is the side of the tomb of Carlosanti and Miralyn Salamir.

The Central Chamber of the Crypt of Familia Von Harovitch~
Utter darkness envelops you, and cobwebs brush eerily against your face.
This abandoned mausoleum has been without mortal visitors in quite some
time. You stand in a very old structure - probably the oldest in the
Boneyard - but it has not been shattered by the weight of time as have
other buildings in this section. Its walls are still dotted here and there 
with the remains of frescoes, and there is some evidence of mosaic work on
the floor. It appears that the Familia Von Harovitch was quite wealthy from
all the decoration here and there, from the ornate stone biers to the
engaged Ionic columns which support the roof. Sealed archways lead into
five individual chambers, each door blazoned with a bronze plaque.

broken paving stones that make up the surface of the path. It is clear that

of a withered tree to the east. To the south lies a courtyard, and the exit

On the pathway, the weeds have thinned, poisoned by whatever lies within
the structure. The pathway runs from north to south, with a wrought iron

The Portico of a Cathedral~
The air is chill here; the dusky stillness and cold that are the antithesis
of sunlight's glow.  Brooding stone walls surround you like the entrance to
a tomb, leading westward into the Cathedral proper.  Torchlight flickers
along the bare, rough marble, making the veins within the rock glitter as
if blood flowed through them.  Your foot-steps make no sound as your feet
sink deep into a dark wine-colored carpet.

A Cathedral to an Unknown God~
The enormity of this chamber is stunning.  The ceiling vaults far overhead
into a graceful dome, and spans a massive length - that of a mature dragon
from corner to corner. Rows of heavily carved ebony pews firmly lead one's
gaze up the thickly carpeted central corridor towards the altar and apse,
which are decorated with ornate frescoes and mosaics. Stained glass windows
reach skyward, turning the light that streams through them a bloody wash of
color.
Your gaze cannot pierce the shifting gloom of the distant corners of the
cathedral, nor into the many alcoves. This is a profoundly unholy place,
dedicated to some unknown creature of great power.

An Alcove of the Cathedral~
This empty cobweb-filled alcove along the southern wall of the Cathedral
appears to have been used as a confessors booth at one point; the tormented
writings of those seeking forgiveness and communication cover the walls.
Inset in the floor of the booth is a heavy metal grate, with a massive
lock.  Soft, terrified moans emit from beneath the grate, and for a moment
you thought you heard the rustling of wings.

A Small Side-Chapel~
This small chapel appears to have been altered into a storage area of
sorts. The pews have all been removed, creating an open space, though its
purpose is not clear. A small passageway leads to the main chapel to the
north, and a massive hearth lies to the south, its size and the strength of
the flames within quite unusual for such a small room.

The Sanctuary of the Cathedral~
You find yourself in a room echoing the curve of the dome below; the
translucent gray crystal walls curve up and inward in a smooth, seamless
arc, permitting the natural light to enter in a shrouded, dusky form and
fall through the oculus to the Cathedral below. The chamber is Spartan and
bare, with no unnecessary fripperies.  It needs none. The still potent
presence of Whomever this place was consecrated to is palpable.

A Walled Off Crypt~
Newer dark brick fragments scatter the northern section of the floor of
this centuries-old crypt. Dark stains mar the walls, pale lichen growing in
the trails of moisture that have seeped down from the ceiling. The chamber
is small, with two stone biers flanking a central pathway that runs north
to south. A heavy iron door bars the south portal, twin to one that
barriers the north. The door to the north is twisted, as if it was nearly
wrenched from its hinges at some point.

The Antechamber~
This claustrophobically small, rectangular stone chamber shows the wearing
of time. Some of the masonry is crumbling, with jutting tree roots
protruding out from between the stones of the walls and low ceiling.
Condensation creates dark trails down the walls, and there is no light
source here to illuminate your passage.  Opposite the entry way, statues of
lions flank a doorway leading deeper into this crypt complex. The scent of
rot is heavy in the air.

The Crypt of Storivad Von Harovich~
There is no light here to reveal what rests down in this hidden tomb. No
illumination to give color to the dark stains upon stone and torn flesh.
Heavy shadows mercifully hide the carnage of this subterranean abattoir. 
The air is still, as if Death had caught and held Her breath, but still,
there is a heavy sweetness that floods your nostrils, overlaying a foul,
gag-inducing rot and the scent of spilled bowels.

The stately coffin lays unused and empty upon a massive black 
stone catafalque. It is draped in the Von Harovich colors, an 
ornate seal bearing the house sigil upon the lid.
