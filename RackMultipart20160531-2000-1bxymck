Mo'pakshakur~
An undeniably large sahuagin swims around, admiring the weapons.

Mo'pakshakur, the greatest living sahuagin warrior, is the largest of his
race. Standing at eight feet tall, he has no body fat - the striations of
each muscle are visible and clear. Without speaking or taking his eyes off
you, he nods once at his big stick on the ceiling, implying he may not be
done adding dents ... or notches.

An age ago, ettins shaped the mountains and valleys through brute strength. 
Few among them had the intelligence to complement that strength, but those

here by unknown means, found a way to magick the waters and preserve body
and mind beyond death.

Trapped in this enormous underground chasm, the mighty undead ettin has been
pounding his prison walls for an eternity, looking for passage out.  Now the
door is open, and his path is clear.

Inside a Rock Dome~
Looking around, a large rock dome encloses this space -- ceiling and
walls are solid stone, and covered in black, slimy moss.  Conversely,
the ground beneath is exceedingly spongy and wet.  Bouncing off the
rock are the intermittent yet deafening sounds of dripping water.

The air is damp and stale, threatening to extinguish any light source
born of fire.

Perhaps fifty feet above, slippery black moss coats all. It has worked
its way around every bulge, into every crevice, over every stalagmite.

Every few moments, a drop of water forms somewhere above and plops to
the ground, sliding down one of the many moss-covered stalagtites to
the dampness below.

Some distance from the ceiling, hovering like a storm cloud but oddly
silent, a vast grey vortex swirls soundlessly.

Like all big, wet sponges, the ground squishes under any notable weight.
Alas, no stalagmites rise up to eventually meet their counterparts above.
Instead, to an endless beat, water plops onto the saturated surface.

The center of the rock dome's floor looks especially damp - water can be
seen actually bubbling up through the porous floor. Mayhap an opening to
the wetness below lies there.

artful hands managed to acquire unparalleled wealth in all the oceans. He
single-handedly funded the first Triton-Sahuagin war. Rumors abound as to
how he handled the affair, but it is an inarguable fact that his coffers
suddenly became full after a bizarre rendezvous with a large masked wyrm,
aqua in color. Perhaps not coincidentally, this was also around the time
Or'shalkpirsi was slain in his sleep.

Still shackled to the wall, a corpse of a two-headed Giant-kin remains

rarely swim.

There have been tales of two-headed giants, but none have been seen alive
in many an age...  Ettins, they were called.  The story behind this one
must be fantastic, though woe begets the scene.

All limbs are drawn and chained far out from the body in an 'X' formation,
and both heads slump to the ettin's chest.  Shockingly, it is from behind 
this creature that the thumping seems to originate.

a dark green tunnel.  And to the north, a wooden structure groans now

An Opening in a Crushed Bow of a Sunken Vessel~
Smashed on the rocks far above near the surface, the wooden vessel has
split, the bow coming to rest in the great kelp forest east of Tiren's
Rock.  As the years have passed, the wood has become heavily covered in
barnacles and corals, but has not rotted to a great extent.  Many of the
ocean's favorite creatures now call this devastated ship their home.

The Tiren's Rock Warehouse Sea Lock~
This gigantic structure is made entirely of a mountainous formation of coral. 
Whether it was carved into its current shape or convinced to grow that way 
through sahuagin magic is an impossible task to discern. This section of the 
building is a sea-lock, granting access to the warehouse in a way that does 
not flood the dry interior. A pair of stout doors to the west and east block 
the way. A school of bladderfishes have been harnessed to small openings, 
and it is their labor that sucks water out of the chamber and expels it 
through an odd series of valves.

To the west, flanking the sea-lock door, are piles of packages and bins a
