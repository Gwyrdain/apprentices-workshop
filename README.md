Wish List
---
* Map feature: overhead map of the area and you could click on any room to edit it
* Graphic icons for items, mobs, and rooms and then being able to drag/drop them into their proper place for resets so you’d look at a map of an area and then on the right side of the screen there’d be a list of mobs with little icons and you could drag the icon into the room you want it to reset and it’d do all the resets for you or you can click on the mob or the room and it’d open up the edit screen for that item/mob/room
* Add jQ/AJAX for better experience!
