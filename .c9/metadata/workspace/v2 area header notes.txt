I created it with two ideas in mind. First, I wanted something that would be easier to add content to (such as an installation date). I also wanted to try a format that was more flexible (element order largely unimportant), and more language based (avoid numbers). Obviously, Muditor would have kittens upon seeing this. I'm not going to wiki it just yet. I'd like feedback.","","Two areas have been \"converted:\" The guild and Aerie Volant.","","In general, the element is listed first, followed by one or more values, depending on the type. As usual, string values end with a tilde (~). Elements not provided in the #AREA section are defaulted.","","The current recognized elements:","FORMAT <number> e.g. Format 2 - Specifies the format \"version.\" In order to maintain compatibility with the standard #AREA header, the FORMAT element must be first.","* - literal asterisk. Line comment.","AUTHOR <string name name [...]> e.g. Author Tynian Maurice IvoryTiger~ - Lists one or more author names. Among other things, the area command will search for authors. For example, Pitt is credited as a go-author for Volant, and AREA PITT will show Volant.","DESCRIPTION <string> e.g. Description This sample area is admired by none.~","END - Ends the #AREA block","FLAGS <text> <text> [...] - e.g. Flags manmade city forest 16 End - Provides one or more area flags. Will also accept numerical flag numbers. Must end with 'End'.","HIGHLEVEL <num> - e.g. Highlevel 50 - Provides the recommended highest level for the area.","INSTALLED <YYYY-MM-DD> - e.g. Installed 2014-07-01 - Installation date.","LOWLEVEL <num) e.g. Lowlevel 1 - Provides the recommended lowest level for the area.","REVISION $Revision$ - The value must be this exact format.
